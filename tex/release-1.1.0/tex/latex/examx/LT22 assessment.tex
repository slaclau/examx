%		\question
%		A body of mass $\qty{20}{\kg}$ is on a rough plane inclined at angle $\alpha$ to the horizontal.
%		
%		The body is held at rest on the plane by the action of a force of magnitude $P\,\unit{\N}$.
%		
%		The force is acting up the plane in a direction parallel to a line of greatest slope of the plane.
%		 
%		The coefficient of friction between the body and the plane is $\mu$.
